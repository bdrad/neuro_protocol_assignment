I would like to avoid ordering one, then getting a response that it is the wrong one, and need to re-submit another eReferral. He was seen for a lump on his rib in ultrasound 10/31/17 (results in LCR apparently showing soft tissue in bone).      While waiting for that ultrasound study, he may or may not have had another lump emerge in his bellybutton (he is not sure if his bellybutton has changed, but it feels abnormal to me). The ultrasonographer sent a message saying they would not assess his bellybutton (if I am interpreting the message correctly) because I ordered an abdominal ultrasound.      Mr. Coleman has no symptoms, but has advanced HIV, recently only taking his medications intermittently, and now (this week) has a drop in his CD4 from 500 to 284.

Had f/u MRI brain done 5/7/14 showing improved vasogenic edema, stable lesions, with some areas of improvement, no new lesions. Had additional MRI done 11/3/2014 at highland and we have yet to obtain results of that MRI.

Felicia Chow messaged me to let me know he missed his Neurology appt and she said that his imaging does not seem to be a ""good fit"" for cysticercosis and we agreed to do a f/u MRI in 6-9 mos to assess for stability    I called radiology and they say that the lesions are improved since his initial scans in January of 2014 when he was first treated for tb, but they are stable since his scan in November of 2014. They said that the rim enhancement suggests breakdown of the blood brain barrier which would suggest ongoing inflammation, but the calcifications were consistent with treatment leading them to say it was suggestive of ""partial treatment."" So, the improvement with TB treatment would suggest to me that this was TB. Or I suppose another infection that responds to TB treatment. I'm not really sure why they are still enhancing but not growing in the past 3 years. Can you have active TB that doesn't grow or is reactivated when not on ARV's in the same location of the brain?

Has mild swelling just medial to medial malleollus and very TTP, unable to put much weight on foot without sharp pain. Unable to attend work currently. Insisting on MRI to look for stress fracture.

If less than one week pls do PRICE and treat like common strain/sprain.  Can offer ankle brace/air cast for support. If >2-3  wks of conservative treatment. Let us know and we can help eval.                  07/18/2018  SONJA GOETSCH-AVILA (Provider)    Per PCP, Bennett Lareau-Meredith:    I spoke with the client and provided this recommendation, and she was very upset by this. She is concerned that there may be a stress fracture and was told by a family member who is an MD that the xray views that were obtained at ED were not sufficient to determine if there is a stress fracture. Her job requires her to be on her feet and she wants more information to help her determine how to proceed with going back to work. Are there more complete xray images that can be obtained at this point, or is MRI the only option for revealing a stress fracture? She is not taking no for an answer in terms of getting more imaging right now. Thank you.                   07/19/2018      BRENDA STENGELE (Orthopedic Services Orthopaedic Surgery - ZSFG (Adult, Pediatrics))   MRI is the only option to id a stress fx so if that's what the concern is then send for an MRI and re-submit for review of imaging.

His case can't be reviewed again until he has had updated imaging.  I don't see that it has been ordered (though admittedly it's sometimes hard to tell with eConsult).  If you can arrange for CT liver protocol or MRI this week, he could be added to the roster for 8/13/18.          After 8/13, the next liver tumor board will be 9/10.
